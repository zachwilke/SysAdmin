#SysAdmin Software I Love

##7zip
This is by far the best file archiver out there. Its fast, lightweight, and open-source.

##WinDirStat
This application is an open0source disk utilization analyzer. It works well and while looking dated, proven itself to be efficient despite its age. WinDirStat is also open-source which I am a huge fan of.

##Visual Studio Code
This editor is an open-source application developed by Microsoft. There is a reason it is one of the most used code editors. Its fast, efficient, and really intelligent. I use this mainly for reading various syntax with its fantastic out-of-the box syntax highlighting. I also use this for script writing in Powershell and Bash. It is also cross-platform.

##OneNote
This application needs no introduction. It is not open-source and proprietary to Microsoft. However, I find its features, mobile app, cross-platform syncing, and overall usability to be second to none. There are plenty of note-taking applications out there but this is my preferred. Its probably because of the dark mode option.

##Microsoft To Do
This is on the list because I was a Wunderlist fanatic for years. Wunderlist is now Microsoft To Do's. The functionality is still there, just under a different name. The ability to categorize tasks is by far my favorite feature.

##Advanced IP Scanner
This is my favorite IP/Port scan tool. It is lightweight, fast, and can even be run off the installer without having to install the application.

##Wireshark
Wireshark also needs no introduction. When dealing with networking issues and network discovery, getting into the deeper elements of an issue is best handled with this open source network analyzer. It definitely has a learning curve, but once you begin to understand how to use highlights and filters, there is no replacing it. It is also cross-platform.

##Windows Terminal with WSL
This is a newer one for me. The new Windows Terminal found in the Microsoft Store (Only available on Windows of course) is a terminal emulator that brings all of your CLIs together in one application. Paired with Microsoft's new Windows Subsystem for Linux, I can run Powershell Core, CMD, and Ubuntu 20.04 simulataneously in one tabbed application. I have really enjoyed it and been super impressed with the intuitiveness. While I don't use Git too much in my role, I have seen its fantastic integration with pulls and commits.
